iLab Liberia Election Promise Tracker and Data
==============================================

We used Tabula https://tabula.nerdpower.org to extract the data from Progressive Provisional Candidate Listing, released Friday July 14, 2017 http://www.necliberia.org/pg_img/Nomination%20Listing.pdf into a CSV file. We also use incumbent candidate lists from Wikipedia and geodata from OpenStreetMap to add extra context to the listing.
