iLab Liberia Election Promise Tracker and Data
==============================================

We used Tabula https://tabula.nerdpower.org to extract the data from Progressive Provisional Candidate Listing, released Friday July 14, 2017 http://www.necliberia.org/pg_img/Nomination%20Listing.pdf into a CSV file. We also use incumbent candidate lists from Wikipedia and geodata from OpenStreetMap to add extra context to the listing.

Most of the DistrictPopPlace's were extracted from OpenStreetMap using an Overpass Turbo query and joined with the electoral districts supplied by the [Liberia NEC](http://www.necliberia.org/).

Final candidates are due to be released on July 31, 2017.
